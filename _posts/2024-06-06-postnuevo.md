This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown. I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - itâ€™ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.
I also encourage you to look at the code that created this post to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.
